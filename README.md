# Let's just take a step back and look at where we are and where we want to go

The purpose of this app is to build a handy portfolio checker for the person who wants a picture of how selected assets are performing in relation to one another and to the portfolio as a whole. 

As this is meant to be a custom app, a client's principal holdings will be hardcoded to use as a baseline for comparison an real time. The real time share prices will be accessed through yahoo finance api, accessed through rapid api. 

Because I intent to build out user interaction, I want to build the front end in react, however, I would prefer not to make repeated API calls in a single session. Additionally, in order to make customer centric visualizations I need to merge current prices with the principal variables. This is all better handled in the back end.
